Invisible Internet Protocol (daemon)
====================================

i2pd (I2P Daemon) is a fully-featured C++ implementation of the I2P protocol.

I2P (Invisible Internet Protocol) is a universal anonymous network layer. 
All communications over I2P are anonymous and end-to-end encrypted, and participants
don't reveal their real IP addresses. 

An I2P client is an application for building and traversing anonymous I2P 
networks. Such networks are commonly used for both anonymous peer-to-peer 
applications (filesharing, cryptocurrencies) and anonymous client-server 
applications (websites, instant messengers, chat-servers).

I2P allows people from all around the world to communicate and share information
without restrictions.
