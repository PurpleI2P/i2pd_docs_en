## Docker images

You can use our [prebuilt docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/purplei2p/i2pd/).

    docker pull purplei2p/i2pd


## Linux

### Distro-agnostic GUI

You can install i2pd GUI from Flathub using `flatpak`:

    sudo apt install flatpak
    flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
    flatpak install flathub website.i2pd.i2pd

### Arch

i2pd packages are available at Arch's [extra repository](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/i2pd/) for release version, and [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/i2pd-git/) for nightly builds.

You can download them by running 

     pacman -S i2pd --noconfirm

### Gentoo

i2pd [has a working ebuild in the main gentoo repository](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/net-vpn/i2pd). As of May 2018, the ebuild 
is still listed as "unstable", and thus will request an exception in your package.keywords if you are using gentoo under the "stable" branch.
To install i2pd, enter the command:
    
    emerge --ask net-vpn/i2pd

If you use `gcc` to compile packages and would like to enable cmake's hardening features, use the `i2p-hardening` flag (recommended).
If you intend to use the websocket server, enable the `websocket` flag.

### Debian

Look for Debian packages at the [latest release page](https://github.com/PurpleI2P/i2pd/releases/latest).

Alternatively, you can install i2pd by using repository run by PurpleI2P community member [R4SAS](https://twitter.com/i2pr4sas).

Install apt-transport-https package

    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

Automatically add repository

    wget -q -O - https://repo.i2pd.xyz/.help/add_repo | sudo bash -s -

After that you can install i2pd as any other software package:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install i2pd
