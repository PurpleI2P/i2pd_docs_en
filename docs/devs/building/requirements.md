Build requirements
==================

In general, for building i2pd you need several things:

* compiler with C++17 full support (for example: MSVC >= 2019, GCC >= 9, Clang >= 10)
* boost >= 1.66
* openssl library >= 1.1.1 (or libressl library >= 4.0)
* zlib library

Optional tools:

* cmake >= 2.8 (or 3.3+ if you want to use precompiled headers on windows)
* miniupnp library (for upnp support)
